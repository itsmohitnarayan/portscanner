## Introduction

This Python Simple Port Scanner is a command-line tool that allows you to scan a target host or IP address for open ports within a specified range. It utilizes multithreading to improve scanning speed and efficiently check multiple ports simultaneously.

## Features

- Scan a target host or IP address for open ports.
- Specify a range of ports to scan.
- Utilizes multithreading for faster scanning.
- Displays open ports if found during the scan.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your computer.

## Usage

To use the Python Simple Port Scanner, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/port-scanner.git
   ```

2. Change the directory to the cloned repository:
   ```bash
   cd port-scanner
   ```

3. Run the port scanner with the following command, replacing `[TARGET]`, `[START_PORT]`, and `[END_PORT]` with the desired target and port range:
   ```bash
   python3 portscanner.py [TARGET] [START_PORT] [END_PORT]
   ```

   Example:
   ```bash
   python3 portscanner.py example.com 80 100
